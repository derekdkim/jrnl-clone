# JRNL Clone

**Disclaimer: All assets and design belong to JRNL, an actual web-based journal writing service. This project only mimics the basic functionality of the service for web development practice. Do not use this project for any purpose other than demo-ing. Please visit [JRNL](jrnl.com) to see the real service.** 

**Note: This app is not responsive as it was styled using static units. Please do not visit the site in mobile. It will be revisited at some point in the future.**
## Objective

JRNL Clone is an exercise in building an existing website using React as frontend and Google Firebase for hosting and server-side database. The basic features replicated were made within the constraints of the free "Spark" plan in Google Firebase. There is zero intent to commercialize or use this project for any purpose other than demonstrating web development skills.

## Usage

**Visit [the website](https://jrnl-clone.web.app/) hosted on Google Firebase.**

### Features
